Taking the intern for a little test drive...


# ROADMAP

## Objectives accomplished:

* unit testing (both in node, local browser and remote webdriver)
* functional testing (in remote webdriver)
* working with browser AMD modules
* working with browser js files no-AMD
* skip instrumentation (not useful for now)


## Yet to accomplish:

* functional test is very crippled so far
* perform async test in both unit test and functional tests
* generate USEFUL report information
* try the geezer version and see if its any worse
