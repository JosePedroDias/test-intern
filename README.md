Taking the intern for a little test drive...


# ROADMAP

## Objectives accomplished:

* unit testing (both in node, local browser and remote webdriver)
* functional testing (in remote webdriver)
* working with browser AMD modules
* working with browser js files no-AMD
* created junit reporter
* created json reporter
* reporters are recording each browser session to a different file


## Ongoing work:

* aggregate reports into matrix (ditch jenkins altogether?)
* continue the functional test sample (far from perfect)


## Yet to tackle:

* perform async test in both unit test and functional tests
* generate USEFUL report information (aggregate)
* try the geezer version and see if its any worse


I'm [writing a tutorial](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/test-intern/wiki/Tutorial) about this too.
