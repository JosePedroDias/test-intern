Taking the intern for a little test drive...


# ROADMAP

## Objectives accomplished:

* unit testing (both in node, local browser and remote webdriver)
* functional testing (in remote webdriver)
* working with browser AMD modules
* working with browser js files no-AMD


## Ongoing work:

* writing a custom reporter that outputs JUnit XML compliant to JenkinsCI
    * compute each env to different xml file or matrix?!
* continue the functional test sample (far from perfect)


## Yet to tackle:

* perform async test in both unit test and functional tests
* try the geezer version and see if its any worse


I'm [writing a tutorial](https://github.com/JosePedroDias/test-intern/wiki/Tutorial) about this too.
